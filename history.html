                <p class="lead">The Metković family house was built in the 1930s, constructed by three brothers and two
                    sisters in a traditional style using local building materials. Stone was sourced from excavations,
                    and the binding material was lime produced in kilns still present today near the beach.
                    The horizontal and roof structure of the house was made from cypress wood cut on the family estate.
                    According to local folklore, when a father had a son, he was obligated to plant at least 50 such
                    trees so that he could later fence his house when he started his own family.
                    These were extremely labor-intensive tasks, as the entire summer was spent cutting down the forest
                    to prepare enough firewood for burning the stone, which would melt into lime. </p>

                    At that time, there
                    was no electricity, so everything was done manually, with horses, mules, and donkeys being the only
                    help in transporting construction materials to the site (lime, water, wood, etc.).
                    The traditional construction style was a suitable way of life, with the upper floor of the house
                    designated for living, and the ground floor serving as cellars for storing agricultural products
                    (wine, oil, dried figs, carob, and other crops cultivated on the 48,000 m2 estate).
                    The income from agriculture financed the construction of the house, along with assistance from the
                    eldest brother who had emigrated to Argentina to earn money for himself and his family. At that
                    time, many people emigrated to North and South America in search of a better life and with the goal
                    of helping their families survive and preserve their estates.

                <p class="lead">Hard life, strenuous work, and frequent wars forced people in this region to leave for
                    the world, so
                    today we have a situation where more Croats live outside Croatia than in their homeland, which is a
                    characteristic of our family.
                    Upon returning from America in 1966, Mato Metković transformed the family house into a vacation home
                    and named it "Villa Palma," a name it still carries today. The dominant position of the house
                    overlooking the bay and the Molunat harbor was attractive to many tourists, but unfortunately, it
                    also attracted armies that devastated it twice: after World War II from 1945 to 1950 and after the
                    Croatia War of Independence from 1991 to 1993.
                    The house has been rented to tourists since 1966, with interruptions ('91 to '93 - war, 2020-2023 -
                    complete reconstruction). </p>

                    Thanks to all the efforts of Metkovic family over the generations the
                    house and the estate still continues to provide all organic produce (olives, oranges, grapes, figs,
                    ...) to the family and their guests. Enabling a truly authentic experience at the estate. Niksa,
                    Mato’s son, and the family continue to put love and effort to maintain this piece of paradise to the
                    best of their ability. Given the complete reconstruction, architects advised demolishing the old
                    house and building a new
                    one. However, we didn't want to demolish the four exterior walls that were the only ones left in the
                    house, even though financially, this made the work more cumbersome and expensive.
                    Once, when I told a friend that I might have should have listened to the architects and demolished
                    everything, he consoled me in an interesting way and said, "but you preserved the soul of the
                    house."

                    Perhaps, unconsciously, he was right, as over 6,000 people have stayed and enjoyed their vacations
                    in that house since it was first rented out. If someone left just a gram of laughter or kindness, it
                    accumulated a lot because I remember from my childhood happy people, stories, laughter, and joy. My
                    father would organize beach picnics at Pasjača, roast kid on a spit, sardine evenings, fishing
                    trips, and long stories about the time before and after World War II, frequent escapes to the world
                    across the Adriatic, all to earn money for the family's survival and estate.
                    The 70s and 80s changed the way of life, and tourism took precedence over agriculture; life became
                    easier, and there was no need to emigrate. Our family still engages in agriculture, the local way of
                    life, share and enjoy the products made with guests.

                    We produce organic extra virgin olive oil from olives planted on our estate over 250 years ago, wine
                    made from Vranac grapes originating from Macedonia and Greece. Many oranges and lemons grow in the
                    large orchard around the house, from which we make jam, and from carob, medlar, grapes, and walnuts,
                    we produce homemade liqueurs.
                    The house has been renovated with traditional materials, most of the furniture is handmade, and
                    modern equipment is used to achieve 5-star luxury. We invested a lot of effort, not sparing time or
                    money, to provide original and authentically Mediterranean service with discreet luxury.
                    The third generation now runs this business, and the experiences and knowledge gained over the years
                    have helped us offer and present the Mediterranean way of life in its original form to our guests.
                    The uniqueness of the western bay of Molunat, where our estate and house are located, lies in the
                    absence of any construction, making it probably the only undeveloped or untouched by human hands bay
                    on the mainland part of the Adriatic.

                    We look forward to and will strive to provide you with an unforgettable and original experience if
                    you decide to be our guests. Our distinctiveness lies in the experience, heritage, and knowledge
                    gained through 60 years of renting, and glimpse of it can be found in the reviews of our old guests,
                    whose children still come today and fondly remember the wonderful moments and time spent in Villa
                    Palma in Molunat. What is rare in modern tourism.
                    Villa Palma is true beauty, a place where you "hear the silence" and enjoy the beauty of untouched
                    nature with all your senses. In the truest sense, it is "the Mediterranean as it once was."
                    In honor to the old guests that have spent their hard earned vacation we left their review here as
                    well.
